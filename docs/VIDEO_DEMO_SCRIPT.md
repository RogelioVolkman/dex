## üìù Detailed Script

### Scene 1: Introduction & Problem Statement (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Traditional fundraising platforms showing public investment data]**

**Narrator**: "In today's blockchain fundraising landscape, every investment is completely public. When you invest $10,000 in a project, everyone can see exactly how much you contributed. This lack of privacy creates several problems..."

**[Graphic: Problems highlighted with icons]**
- "Large investors become targets"
- "Investment strategies are exposed"
- "Market manipulation becomes easier"
- "Privacy is completely sacrificed"

**[Transition: Dark screen with SecretLaunch logo appearing]**

**Narrator**: "Introducing SecretLaunch - the world's first fully confidential fundraising platform powered by Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption protocol."

### Scene 2: Platform Overview & Architecture (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Architecture diagram animation]**

**Narrator**: "SecretLaunch consists of three main components working together:"

**[Animation: Components appearing one by one]**

1. **"Smart Contracts"** - "Built on Ethereum with Zama FHE integration for encrypted data processing"

2. **"Confidential DEX"** - "Trade tokens with completely private order books and balances"

3. **"Frontend Application"** - "User-friendly interface with seamless Web3 wallet integration"

**[Screen: Data flow animation]**

"When you make an investment, your amount is encrypted using homomorphic encryption before being stored on-chain. This means computations can be performed on your data without ever revealing the actual amounts."

---

### Scene 3: Campaign Creation Demo (120 seconds)

**[Screen: Live demonstration - SecretLaunch platform]**

**Narrator**: "Let me show you how easy it is to create a confidential fundraising campaign."

**[Action: Click "Launch Project" button]**

"First, I'll connect my wallet..."

**[Screen: MetaMask popup animation]**

"Now I'll create a new campaign for CryptoShield Pro, a privacy-focused wallet project."

**[Action: Fill out campaign form step by step]**

**Step 1 - Project Details:**
- "I'll enter the project name, token symbol, and description"
- "Notice how I can specify the category and add verification documents"

**Step 2 - Token Configuration:**
- "Here I set the total token supply and initial price"
- "The platform automatically calculates token distribution"

**Step 3 - Sale Parameters:**
- "This is where SecretLaunch shines - I can set different prices for private and public sales"
- "Private sale: $0.05 per token, Public sale: $0.08 per token"
- "Investment limits ensure fair participation"

**Step 4 - Timeline:**
- "Private sale runs for 7 days, followed by a 14-day public sale"
- "25% of raised funds will be allocated for DEX liquidity"

**[Action: Review and launch campaign]**

"After reviewing all details, I'll sign the transaction to launch the campaign."

**[Screen: Success confirmation and campaign card]**

"Perfect! Our campaign is now live with encrypted fundraising targets."

### Scene 4: Private Investment Flow (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Campaign detail page]**

"I'm now connected as a different user who wants to invest in CryptoShield Pro."

**[Screen: Investment interface]**

"I can see the campaign is in the private sale phase, but notice what I CAN'T see - the specific amounts other investors have contributed."

**[Action: Enter investment amount]**

"I'll invest 2 ETH in this campaign. Watch what happens when I submit this investment..."

**[Screen: FHE encryption process visualization]**

"The platform encrypts my investment amount using Zama's FHE protocol before sending it to the smart contract."

**[Action: Confirm transaction in MetaMask]**

"I confirm the transaction, and my investment is recorded on-chain, but the amount remains completely private."

**[Screen: Campaign progress bar updating]**

"The campaign progress updates to show that new funding has been received, but no one can see that I specifically invested 2 ETH."

**[Screen: Investment confirmation]**

"I receive a confirmation that my private investment was successful, along with a commitment hash that I can use to verify my investment later."

**[Action: Fill order details]**

"I'm placing a buy order for tokens at $0.10 each. The order amount and my balance remain completely private."

**[Screen: Order book visualization]**

"Look at the order book - you can see that orders exist and are being matched, but the specific amounts are hidden. This prevents front-running and provides a fair trading environment."

**[Action: Show order execution]**

"When orders match, the trade is executed automatically using homomorphic computations, ensuring both parties get what they agreed to while maintaining complete privacy."

**[Screen: Trading history with privacy indicators]**

"My trading history shows successful trades, but the amounts remain private to me. This gives traders a significant advantage in the market."
